I'm excited to share that I've earned two badges from [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com), a platform focused on deep learning problem-solving!

## 🏆 Certifications Earned

### Attention Is All You Need Badge
Successfully completed all problems in the **Attention Is All You Need** collection, covering the foundational concepts of the Transformer architecture that revolutionized NLP and beyond.

- **Issued:** January 27, 2026

### ResNet Badge
Successfully completed all problems in the **ResNet** collection, mastering residual learning and skip connections that enabled training of very deep neural networks.

- **Issued:** January 27, 2026
- **Credential ID:** `DMLBADGE-RESNET-mkvzwgo0`

## Why These Matter

Both **Transformers** and **ResNet** are foundational architectures in modern deep learning:

- **Transformers** power state-of-the-art models in NLP (BERT, GPT), computer vision (ViT), and even speech recognition (like the ASR models I work on at Samsung).
- **ResNet** introduced residual connections that solved the vanishing gradient problem, enabling networks with hundreds of layers to be trained effectively.

These hands-on problem collections helped reinforce my understanding of the underlying mechanics—from self-attention mechanisms to skip connections.

## What's Next?

I'm looking forward to tackling more Deep-ML collections and continuing to deepen my practical understanding of deep learning architectures. Stay tuned for more updates!
