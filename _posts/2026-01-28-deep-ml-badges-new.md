I'm thrilled to announce that I've earned **3 new badges** on [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/) today!

## 🎖️ Badges Earned

| Badge | Collection | Credential ID |
|---|---|---|
| **Machine Learning Badge** | [Machine Learning](https://www.deep-ml.com/credentials/DMLBADGE-MACHINELEARNING-mkxs68e8) | `DMLBADGE-MACHINELEARNING-mkxs68e8` |
| **Deep Learning Badge** | [Deep Learning](https://www.deep-ml.com/credentials/DMLBADGE-DEEPLEARNING-mkxned67) | `DMLBADGE-DEEPLEARNING-mkxned67` |
| **DenseNet Badge** | [DenseNet](https://www.deep-ml.com/credentials/DMLBADGE-DENSENET-mkxuj45v) | `DMLBADGE-DENSENET-mkxuj45v` |

## 🧠 What I Learned

Completing these collections taught me a wide range of skills:

- **Python & PyTorch** — Core implementation skills
- **Deep Learning** — Neural network architectures from scratch
- **Machine Learning** — Classical algorithms like SVMs and kernel methods
- **LLMs** — GPT-2 architecture and text generation
- **Vision Models** — CNNs, ResNet, DenseNet architectures
- **Convolution Operations** — 2D convolutions, padding, stride
