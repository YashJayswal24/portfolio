I am a Software Engineer at **Samsung HQ** in Suwon, South Korea, where I work on developing and optimizing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on cloud for Bixby. I graduated from the **Indian Institute of Technology Delhi** with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering.

My professional interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Software Engineering with a concetration on resource efficient AI. I have experience in building scalable C++ modules for cloud environments, designing data pipelines, and researching generative AI for semantic communication.

When I'm not coding for work, I enjoy participating in competitive programming (Expert on Codeforces) and exploring new technologies in the AI optimization space.
