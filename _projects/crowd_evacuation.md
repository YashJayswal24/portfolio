**Summary:**
Developed strategies to reduce death count in dense crowd panic situations through simulation. The project focuses on optimizing obstacle shapes and placements to facilitate smoother flow during emergency evacuations.

**Highlights:**
- Reduced death rate by 70% in simulations
- Applied numerical mollification and optimized obstacle shapes
- Utilized C++ for high-performance simulation logic
